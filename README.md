The purpose of this code is to avoid obstacles while coming within a few centimeters of the obtacles (for each obstacle avoided the grader will give you 1 point.)
There is a video showing how to run the code under "Video_robot".
The only problem is that the code is not entirely stable, therefore if you are add additional obstacles or change the environment, the robot may not behave the same.
